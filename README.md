## Project Name: Personal Finance Manager

The Personal Finance Manager is a Python application designed to help individuals manage their finances effectively. It provides a user-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to easily track their income, expenses, and financial goals.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can create accounts and manage their personal finance data securely. Each user can create multiple accounts to track different aspects of their finances, such as savings, expenses, and investments.
- **Database Management**: The application uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with SQLAlchemy to manage the database. It includes tables for users, accounts, transactions, and locations, designed to efficiently store and retrieve financial data.
- **CLI Interface**: The CLI provides a set of commands that users can use to interact with the application. Users can create new accounts, add transactions, view their financial data, and generate reports. The CLI is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces.
